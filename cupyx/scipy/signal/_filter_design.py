    The group delay measures by how many samples amplitude envelopes of

    It is formally defined as the derivative of continuous (unwrapped) phase::

               d        jw
     D(w) = - -- arg H(e)
              dw

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : tuple of array_like (b, a)
        Numerator and denominator coefficients of a filter transfer function.
    w : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        If a single integer, then compute at that many frequencies (default is
        N=512).

        If an array_like, compute the delay at the frequencies given. These
        are in the same units as `fs`.
    whole : bool, optional
        Normally, frequencies are computed from 0 to the Nyquist frequency,
        fs/2 (upper-half of unit-circle). If `whole` is True, compute
        frequencies from 0 to fs. Ignored if w is array_like.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system. Defaults to 2*pi
        radians/sample (so w is from 0 to pi).

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
        The frequencies at which group delay was computed, in the same units
        as `fs`.  By default, `w` is normalized to the range [0, pi)
        (radians/sample).
    gd : ndarray
        The group delay.

    See Also
    --------
    freqz : Frequency response of a digital filter

    Notes
    -----
    The similar function in MATLAB is called `grpdelay`.

    If the transfer function :math:`H(z)` has zeros or poles on the unit
    circle, the group delay at corresponding frequencies is undefined.
    When such a case arises the warning is raised and the group delay
    is set to 0 at those frequencies.

    For the details of numerical computation of the group delay refer to [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    b : array_like
        Numerator of a linear filter. If `b` has dimension greater than 1,
        it is assumed that the coefficients are stored in the first dimension,
        and ``b.shape[1:]``, ``a.shape[1:]``, and the shape of the frequencies
        array must be compatible for broadcasting.
    a : array_like
        Denominator of a linear filter. If `b` has dimension greater than 1,
        it is assumed that the coefficients are stored in the first dimension,
        and ``b.shape[1:]``, ``a.shape[1:]``, and the shape of the frequencies
        array must be compatible for broadcasting.
    worN : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        If a single integer, then compute at that many frequencies (default is
        N=512). This is a convenient alternative to::

            cupy.linspace(0, fs if whole else fs/2, N,
                          endpoint=include_nyquist)

        Using a number that is fast for FFT computations can result in
        faster computations (see Notes).

        If an array_like, compute the response at the frequencies given.
        These are in the same units as `fs`.
    whole : bool, optional
        Normally, frequencies are computed from 0 to the Nyquist frequency,
        fs/2 (upper-half of unit-circle). If `whole` is True, compute
        frequencies from 0 to fs. Ignored if worN is array_like.
    plot : callable
        A callable that takes two arguments. If given, the return parameters
        `w` and `h` are passed to plot. Useful for plotting the frequency
        response inside `freqz`.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system. Defaults to 2*pi
        radians/sample (so w is from 0 to pi).
    include_nyquist : bool, optional
        If `whole` is False and `worN` is an integer, setting `include_nyquist`
        to True will include the last frequency (Nyquist frequency) and is
        otherwise ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
        The frequencies at which `h` was computed, in the same units as `fs`.
        By default, `w` is normalized to the range [0, pi) (radians/sample).
    h : ndarray
        The frequency response, as complex numbers.

    See Also
    --------
    freqz_zpk
    sosfreqz
    scipy.signal.freqz


    Notes
    -----
    Using Matplotlib's :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.plot` function as the callable
    for `plot` produces unexpected results, as this plots the real part of the
    complex transfer function, not the magnitude.
    Try ``lambda w, h: plot(w, cupy.abs(h))``.

    A direct computation via (R)FFT is used to compute the frequency response
    when the following conditions are met:

    1. An integer value is given for `worN`.
    2. `worN` is fast to compute via FFT (i.e.,
       `next_fast_len(worN) <scipy.fft.next_fast_len>` equals `worN`).
    3. The denominator coefficients are a single value (``a.shape[0] == 1``).
    4. `worN` is at least as long as the numerator coefficients
       (``worN >= b.shape[0]``).
    5. If ``b.ndim > 1``, then ``b.shape[-1] == 1``.

    For long FIR filters, the FFT approach can have lower error and be much
    faster than the equivalent direct polynomial calculation.

def freqz_sos(sos, worN=512, whole=False, fs=2*pi):
    r"""
    Compute the frequency response of a digital filter in SOS format.

    Given `sos`, an array with shape (n, 6) of second order sections of
    a digital filter, compute the frequency response of the system function::

               B0(z)   B1(z)         B{n-1}(z)
        H(z) = ----- * ----- * ... * ---------
               A0(z)   A1(z)         A{n-1}(z)

    for z = exp(omega*1j), where B{k}(z) and A{k}(z) are numerator and
    denominator of the transfer function of the k-th second order section.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sos : array_like
        Array of second-order filter coefficients, must have shape
        ``(n_sections, 6)``. Each row corresponds to a second-order
        section, with the first three columns providing the numerator
        coefficients and the last three providing the denominator
        coefficients.
    worN : {None, int, array_like}, optional
        If a single integer, then compute at that many frequencies (default is
        N=512).  Using a number that is fast for FFT computations can result
        in faster computations (see Notes of `freqz`).

        If an array_like, compute the response at the frequencies given (must
        be 1-D). These are in the same units as `fs`.
    whole : bool, optional
        Normally, frequencies are computed from 0 to the Nyquist frequency,
        fs/2 (upper-half of unit-circle). If `whole` is True, compute
        frequencies from 0 to fs.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system. Defaults to 2*pi
        radians/sample (so w is from 0 to pi).

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

    Returns
    -------
    w : ndarray
        The frequencies at which `h` was computed, in the same units as `fs`.
        By default, `w` is normalized to the range [0, pi) (radians/sample).
    h : ndarray
        The frequency response, as complex numbers.

    Gammatone filter design.

    This function computes the coefficients of an FIR or IIR gammatone
    digital filter [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : float
        Center frequency of the filter (expressed in the same units
        as `fs`).
    ftype : {'fir', 'iir'}
        The type of filter the function generates. If 'fir', the function
        will generate an Nth order FIR gammatone filter. If 'iir', the
        function will generate an 8th order digital IIR filter, modeled as
        as 4th order gammatone filter.
    order : int, optional
        The order of the filter. Only used when ``ftype='fir'``.
        Default is 4 to model the human auditory system. Must be between
        0 and 24.
    numtaps : int, optional
        Length of the filter. Only used when ``ftype='fir'``.
        Default is ``fs*0.015`` if `fs` is greater than 1000,
        15 if `fs` is less than or equal to 1000.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the signal. `freq` must be between
        0 and ``fs/2``. Default is 2.

    Returns
    -------
    b, a : ndarray, ndarray
        Numerator (``b``) and denominator (``a``) polynomials of the filter.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `freq` is less than or equal to 0 or greater than or equal to
        ``fs/2``, if `ftype` is not 'fir' or 'iir', if `order` is less than
        or equal to 0 or greater than 24 when ``ftype='fir'``
