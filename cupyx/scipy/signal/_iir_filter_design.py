    """
    IIR digital and analog filter design given order and critical points.

    Design an Nth-order digital or analog filter and return the filter
    coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        The order of the filter.
    Wn : array_like
        A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies.

        For digital filters, `Wn` are in the same units as `fs`. By default,
        `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
        where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (`Wn` is thus in
        half-cycles / sample.)

        For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g., rad/s).

        When Wn is a length-2 sequence, ``Wn[0]`` must be less than ``Wn[1]``.
    rp : float, optional
        For Chebyshev and elliptic filters, provides the maximum ripple
        in the passband. (dB)
    rs : float, optional
        For Chebyshev and elliptic filters, provides the minimum attenuation
        in the stop band. (dB)
    btype : {'bandpass', 'lowpass', 'highpass', 'bandstop'}, optional
        The type of filter.  Default is 'bandpass'.
    analog : bool, optional
        When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
        returned.
    ftype : str, optional
        The type of IIR filter to design:

            - Butterworth   : 'butter'
            - Chebyshev I   : 'cheby1'
            - Chebyshev II  : 'cheby2'
            - Cauer/elliptic: 'ellip'
            - Bessel/Thomson: 'bessel'

    output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
        Filter form of the output:

            - second-order sections (recommended): 'sos'
            - numerator/denominator (default)    : 'ba'
            - pole-zero                          : 'zpk'

        In general the second-order sections ('sos') form  is
        recommended because inferring the coefficients for the
        numerator/denominator form ('ba') suffers from numerical
        instabilities. For reasons of backward compatibility the default
        form is the numerator/denominator form ('ba'), where the 'b'
        and the 'a' in 'ba' refer to the commonly used names of the
        coefficients used.

        Note: Using the second-order sections form ('sos') is sometimes
        associated with additional computational costs: for
        data-intense use cases it is therefore recommended to also
        investigate the numerator/denominator form ('ba').

    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system.

    Returns
    -------
    b, a : ndarray, ndarray
        Numerator (`b`) and denominator (`a`) polynomials of the IIR filter.
        Only returned if ``output='ba'``.
    z, p, k : ndarray, ndarray, float
        Zeros, poles, and system gain of the IIR filter transfer
        function.  Only returned if ``output='zpk'``.
    sos : ndarray
        Second-order sections representation of the IIR filter.
        Only returned if ``output='sos'``.

    Butterworth digital and analog filter design.

    Design an Nth-order digital or analog Butterworth filter and return
    the filter coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        The order of the filter. For 'bandpass' and 'bandstop' filters,

        matrix is ``2*N``, with `N` the number of biquad sections
        of the desired system.
    Wn : array_like
        The critical frequency or frequencies. For lowpass and highpass
        filters, Wn is a scalar; for bandpass and bandstop filters,
        Wn is a length-2 sequence.

        For a Butterworth filter, this is the point at which the gain
        drops to 1/sqrt(2) that of the passband (the "-3 dB point").

        For digital filters, if `fs` is not specified, `Wn` units are
        normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 is the Nyquist frequency (`Wn` is
        thus in half cycles / sample and defined as 2*critical frequencies
        / `fs`). If `fs` is specified, `Wn` is in the same units as `fs`.

        For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g. rad/s).

        The type of filter.  Default is 'lowpass'.

    output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
        Type of output:  numerator/denominator ('ba'), pole-zero ('zpk'), or
        second-order sections ('sos'). Default is 'ba' for backwards
        compatibility, but 'sos' should be used for general-purpose filtering.

    Notes
    -----
    The Butterworth filter has maximally flat frequency response in the
    passband.

    If the transfer function form ``[b, a]`` is requested, numerical
    problems can occur since the conversion between roots and
    the polynomial coefficients is a numerically sensitive operation,
    even for N >= 4. It is recommended to work with the SOS
    representation.

            - Bandstop:  wp = [0.1, 0.6],   ws = [0.2, 0.5]

        For analog filters, `wp` and `ws` are angular frequencies
        (e.g., rad/s). Note, that for bandpass and bandstop filters passband
        must lie strictly inside stopband or vice versa.
    gpass : float
        The maximum loss in the passband (dB).
    gstop : float
        The minimum attenuation in the stopband (dB).
    analog : bool, optional
        When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
        returned.
    ftype : str, optional
        The type of IIR filter to design:

            - Butterworth   : 'butter'
            - Chebyshev I   : 'cheby1'
            - Chebyshev II  : 'cheby2'
            - Cauer/elliptic: 'ellip'

    output : {'ba', 'zpk', 'sos'}, optional
        Filter form of the output:

            - second-order sections (recommended): 'sos'
            - numerator/denominator (default)    : 'ba'
            - pole-zero                          : 'zpk'

        In general the second-order sections ('sos') form  is
        recommended because inferring the coefficients for the
        numerator/denominator form ('ba') suffers from numerical
        instabilities. For reasons of backward compatibility the default
        form is the numerator/denominator form ('ba'), where the 'b'
        and the 'a' in 'ba' refer to the commonly used names of the
        coefficients used.

        Note: Using the second-order sections form ('sos') is sometimes
        associated with additional computational costs: for
        data-intense use cases it is therefore recommended to also
        investigate the numerator/denominator form ('ba').

    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

    z, p, k : ndarray, ndarray, float
        Zeros, poles, and system gain of the IIR filter transfer

    sos : ndarray
        Second-order sections representation of the IIR filter.

def iircomb(w0, Q, ftype='notch', fs=2.0, *, pass_zero=False):
    """
    Design IIR notching or peaking digital comb filter.

    A notching comb filter consists of regularly-spaced band-stop filters with
    a narrow bandwidth (high quality factor). Each rejects a narrow frequency
    band and leaves the rest of the spectrum little changed.

    A peaking comb filter consists of regularly-spaced band-pass filters with
    a narrow bandwidth (high quality factor). Each rejects components outside
    a narrow frequency band.

    Parameters
    ----------
    w0 : float
        The fundamental frequency of the comb filter (the spacing between its
        peaks). This must evenly divide the sampling frequency. If `fs` is
        specified, this is in the same units as `fs`. By default, it is
        a normalized scalar that must satisfy  ``0 < w0 < 1``, with
        ``w0 = 1`` corresponding to half of the sampling frequency.
    Q : float
        Quality factor. Dimensionless parameter that characterizes
        notch filter -3 dB bandwidth ``bw`` relative to its center
        frequency, ``Q = w0/bw``.
    ftype : {'notch', 'peak'}
        The type of comb filter generated by the function. If 'notch', then
        the Q factor applies to the notches. If 'peak', then the Q factor
        applies to the peaks.  Default is 'notch'.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the signal. Default is 2.0.
    pass_zero : bool, optional
        If False (default), the notches (nulls) of the filter are centered on
        frequencies [0, w0, 2*w0, ...], and the peaks are centered on the
        midpoints [w0/2, 3*w0/2, 5*w0/2, ...].  If True, the peaks are centered
        on [0, w0, 2*w0, ...] (passing zero frequency) and vice versa.

    Returns
    -------
    b, a : ndarray, ndarray
        Numerator (``b``) and denominator (``a``) polynomials
        of the IIR filter.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `w0` is less than or equal to 0 or greater than or equal to
        ``fs/2``, if `fs` is not divisible by `w0`, if `ftype`
        is not 'notch' or 'peak'

    Notes
    -----
    The TF implementation of the
    comb filter is numerically stable even at higher orders due to the
    use of a single repeated pole, which won't suffer from precision loss.
