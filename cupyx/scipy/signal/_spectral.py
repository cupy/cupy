def lombscargle(x, y, freqs, precenter=False, normalize=False):
    """
    lombscargle(x, y, freqs)

    Computes the Lomb-Scargle periodogram.

    The Lomb-Scargle periodogram was developed by Lomb [1]_ and further
    extended by Scargle [2]_ to find, and test the significance of weak
    periodic signals with uneven temporal sampling.

    When *normalize* is False (default) the computed periodogram
    is unnormalized, it takes the value ``(A**2) * N/4`` for a harmonic
    signal with amplitude A for sufficiently large N.

    When *normalize* is True the computed periodogram is normalized by
    the residuals of the data around a constant reference model (at zero).

    Input arrays should be one-dimensional and will be cast to float64.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Sample times.
    y : array_like
        Measurement values.
    freqs : array_like
        Angular frequencies for output periodogram.
    precenter : bool, optional
        Pre-center amplitudes by subtracting the mean.
    normalize : bool, optional
        Compute normalized periodogram.

    Returns
    -------
    pgram : array_like
        Lomb-Scargle periodogram.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the input arrays `x` and `y` do not have the same shape.

    Notes
    -----
    This subroutine calculates the periodogram using a slightly
    modified algorithm due to Townsend [3]_ which allows the
    periodogram to be calculated using only a single pass through
    the input arrays for each frequency.
    The algorithm running time scales roughly as O(x * freqs) or O(N^2)
    for a large number of samples and frequencies.

    Estimate power spectral density using Welch's method.

    periodograms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time series of measurement values
    fs : float, optional
        Sampling frequency of the `x` time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional

        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are

        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
        length of the window.
    noverlap : int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired. If
        `None`, the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to `None`.
    detrend : str or function or `False`, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a
        string, it is passed as the `type` argument to the `detrend`
        function. If it is a function, it takes a segment and returns a
        detrended segment. If `detrend` is `False`, no detrending is
        done. Defaults to 'constant'.
    return_onesided : bool, optional
        If `True`, return a one-sided spectrum for real data. If
        `False` return a two-sided spectrum. Defaults to `True`, but for
        complex data, a two-sided spectrum is always returned.
    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
        Selects between computing the power spectral density ('density')
        where `Pxx` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the power
        spectrum ('spectrum') where `Pxx` has units of V**2, if `x`
        is measured in V and `fs` is measured in Hz. Defaults to
        'density'
    axis : int, optional

        over the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).
    average : { 'mean', 'median' }, optional
        Method to use when averaging periodograms. Defaults to 'mean'.


    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    Pxx : ndarray
        Power spectral density or power spectrum of x.

    See Also
    --------
    periodogram: Simple, optionally modified periodogram
    lombscargle: Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled data

    Notes
    -----
    An appropriate amount of overlap will depend on the choice of window
    and on your requirements. For the default Hann window an overlap of
    50% is a reasonable trade off between accurately estimating the
    signal power, while not over counting any of the data. Narrower
    windows may require a larger overlap.

    If `noverlap` is 0, this method is equivalent to Bartlett's method
    [2]_.

    Notes
    -----
    In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT in
    `istft`, it is sufficient that the signal windowing obeys the constraint of
    "Constant OverLap Add" (COLA). This ensures that every point in the input
    data is equally weighted, thereby avoiding aliasing and allowing full
    reconstruction.

    Some examples of windows that satisfy COLA:
        - Rectangular window at overlap of 0, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...
        - Bartlett window at overlap of 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, ...
        - Hann window at 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...
        - Any Blackman family window at 2/3 overlap
        - Any window with ``noverlap = nperseg-1``

    A very comprehensive list of other windows may be found in [2]_,
    wherein the COLA condition is satisfied when the "Amplitude
    Flatness" is unity. See [1]_ for more information.

    istft: Inverse Short Time Fourier Transform

    Notes
    -----
    In order to enable inversion of an STFT via the inverse STFT in
    `istft`, the signal windowing must obey the constraint of "nonzero
    overlap add" (NOLA):

    .. math:: \sum_{t}w^{2}[n-tH] \ne 0

    for all :math:`n`, where :math:`w` is the window function, :math:`t` is the
    frame index, and :math:`H` is the hop size (:math:`H` = `nperseg` -
    `noverlap`).

    This ensures that the normalization factors in the denominator of the
    overlap-add inversion equation are not zero. Only very pathological windows
    will fail the NOLA constraint.

    See [1]_, [2]_ for more information.
