    Calculate the prominence of each peak in a signal.

    The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak stands out from the
    surrounding baseline of the signal and is defined as the vertical distance
    between the peak and its lowest contour line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : sequence
        A signal with peaks.
    peaks : sequence
        Indices of peaks in `x`.
    wlen : int, optional
        A window length in samples that optionally limits the evaluated area
        for each peak to a subset of `x`. The peak is always placed in the
        middle of the window therefore the given length is rounded up to the
        next odd integer. This parameter can speed up the calculation
        (see Notes).

    Returns
    -------
    prominences : ndarray
        The calculated prominences for each peak in `peaks`.
    left_bases, right_bases : ndarray
        The peaks' bases as indices in `x` to the left and right of each peak.
        The higher base of each pair is a peak's lowest contour line.

    Raises
    ------

        For indices in `peaks` that don't point to valid local maxima in `x`,
        the returned prominence will be 0 and this warning is raised. This
        also happens if `wlen` is smaller than the plateau size of a peak.

    peak_widths
        Calculate the width of peaks.

    Notes
    -----
    Strategy to compute a peak's prominence:

    1. Extend a horizontal line from the current peak to the left and right
       until the line either reaches the window border (see `wlen`) or
       intersects the signal again at the slope of a higher peak. An
       intersection with a peak of the same height is ignored.
    2. On each side find the minimal signal value within the interval defined
       above. These points are the peak's bases.
    3. The higher one of the two bases marks the peak's lowest contour line.
       The prominence can then be calculated as the vertical difference between
       the peaks height itself and its lowest contour line.

    Searching for the peak's bases can be slow for large `x` with periodic
    behavior because large chunks or even the full signal need to be evaluated
    for the first algorithmic step. This evaluation area can be limited with
    the parameter `wlen` which restricts the algorithm to a window around the
    current peak and can shorten the calculation time if the window length is
    short in relation to `x`.
    However, this may stop the algorithm from finding the true global contour
    line if the peak's true bases are outside this window. Instead, a higher
    contour line is found within the restricted window leading to a smaller
    calculated prominence. In practice, this is only relevant for the highest
    set of peaks in `x`. This behavior may even be used intentionally to
    calculate "local" prominences.

    rel_height : float, optional
        Chooses the relative height at which the peak width is measured as a

        The height of the contour lines at which the `widths` where evaluated.
    left_ips, right_ips : ndarray

        Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.
    peak_prominences
        Calculate the prominence of peaks.

    Notes
    -----
    The basic algorithm to calculate a peak's width is as follows:

    * Calculate the evaluation height :math:`h_{eval}` with the formula
      :math:`h_{eval} = h_{Peak} - P \\cdot R`, where :math:`h_{Peak}` is the
      height of the peak itself, :math:`P` is the peak's prominence and
      :math:`R` a positive ratio specified with the argument `rel_height`.
    * Draw a horizontal line at the evaluation height to both sides, starting
      at the peak's current vertical position until the lines either intersect
      a slope, the signal border or cross the vertical position of the peak's
      base (see `peak_prominences` for an definition). For the first case,
      intersection with the signal, the true intersection point is estimated
      with linear interpolation.
    * Calculate the width as the horizontal distance between the chosen
      endpoints on both sides. As a consequence of this the maximal possible
      width for each peak is the horizontal distance between its bases.

    As shown above to calculate a peak's width its prominence and bases must be
    known. You can supply these yourself with the argument `prominence_data`.
    Otherwise, they are internally calculated (see `peak_prominences`).

        conditions:

        * 'peak_heights'
              If `height` is given, the height of each peak in `x`.

              If `prominence` is given, these keys are accessible. See
              `peak_prominences` for a description of their content.
        * 'width_heights', 'left_ips', 'right_ips'
              If `width` is given, these keys are accessible. See `peak_widths`

    peak_widths
        Directly calculate the width of peaks.

    Notes
    -----
    In the context of this function, a peak or local maximum is defined as any
    sample whose two direct neighbours have a smaller amplitude. For flat peaks
    (more than one sample of equal amplitude wide) the index of the middle
    sample is returned (rounded down in case the number of samples is even).
    For noisy signals the peak locations can be off because the noise might
    change the position of local maxima. In those cases consider smoothing the
    signal before searching for peaks or use other peak finding and fitting
    methods (like `find_peaks_cwt`).

    Some additional comments on specifying conditions:

    * Almost all conditions (excluding `distance`) can be given as half-open or
      closed intervals, e.g., ``1`` or ``(1, None)`` defines the half-open
      interval :math:`[1, \\infty]` while ``(None, 1)`` defines the interval
      :math:`[-\\infty, 1]`. The open interval ``(None, None)`` can be specified
      as well, which returns the matching properties without exclusion of peaks.
    * The border is always included in the interval used to select valid peaks.
    * For several conditions the interval borders can be specified with
      arrays matching `x` in shape which enables dynamic constrains based on
      the sample position.
    * The conditions are evaluated in the following order: `plateau_size`,
      `height`, `threshold`, `distance`, `prominence`, `width`. In most cases
      this order is the fastest one because faster operations are applied first
      to reduce the number of peaks that need to be evaluated later.
    * While indices in `peaks` are guaranteed to be at least `distance` samples
      apart, edges of flat peaks may be closer than the allowed `distance`.
    * Use `wlen` to reduce the time it takes to evaluate the conditions for
      `prominence` or `width` if `x` is large or has many local maxima
      (see `peak_prominences`).

        Function to use to compare two data points.

    Calculate the relative minima of `data`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Array in which to find the relative minima.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to select from `data`.  Default is 0.

        Default 'clip'. See cupy.take.


    Returns
    -------
    extrema : tuple of ndarrays
        Indices of the minima in arrays of integers.  ``extrema[k]`` is
        the array of indices of axis `k` of `data`.  Note that the
        return value is a tuple even when `data` is one-dimensional.

    See Also
    --------
    argrelextrema, argrelmax, find_peaks

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses `argrelextrema` with cupy.less as comparator. Therefore
    it requires a strict inequality on both sides of a value to consider it a
    minimum. This means flat minima (more than one sample wide) are not
    detected. In case of one-dimensional `data` `find_peaks` can be used to
    detect all local minima, including flat ones, by calling it with negated
    `data`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from cupyx.scipy.signal import argrelmin
    >>> import cupy
    >>> x = cupy.array([2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0])

    Parameters
