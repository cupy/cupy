    r"""Compute the weighted geometric mean along the specified axis.

    The weighted geometric mean of the array :math:`a_i` associated to weights
    :math:`w_i` is:

    .. math::

        \exp \left( \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \ln a_i }{ \sum_{i=1}^n w_i }
                   \right) \, ,

    and, with equal weights, it gives:

    .. math::

        \sqrt[n]{ \prod_{i=1}^n a_i } \, .

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : cupy.ndarray
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which the geometric mean is computed. Default is 0.
        If None, compute over the whole array `a`.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type to which the input arrays are cast before the calculation is
        performed.
    weights : cupy.ndarray, optional
        The `weights` array must be broadcastable to the same shape as `a`.
        Default is None, which gives each value a weight of 1.0.

    Returns
    -------
    gmean : ndarray
        See `dtype` parameter above.

    Notes
    -----
    The sample geometric mean is the exponential of the mean of the natural
    logarithms of the observations.
    Negative observations will produce NaNs in the output because the *natural*
    logarithm (as opposed to the *complex* logarithm) is defined only for
    non-negative reals.
