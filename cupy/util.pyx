    The developer of an API can mark it as *experimental* by calling

    The presentation of :class:`FutureWarning` is disabled by setting
    ``cupy.disable_experimental_warning`` to ``True``,

    We can also make a whole class experimental. In that case,
    we should call this function in its ``__init__`` method.

    .. testcode::

    If we want to mark ``__init__`` method only, rather than class itself,
    it is recommended that we explicitly feed its API name.
