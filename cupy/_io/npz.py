    This function just calls ``numpy.load`` and then sends the arrays to the
    current device. NPZ file is converted to NpzFile object, which defers the
    transfer to the time of accessing the items.

    Args:
        file (file-like object or string): The file to read.
        mmap_mode (None, 'r+', 'r', 'w+', 'c'): If not ``None``, memory-map the
            file to construct an intermediate :class:`numpy.ndarray` object and
            transfer it to the current device.
        allow_pickle (bool): Allow loading pickled object arrays stored in npy
            files. Reasons for disallowing pickles include security, as
            loading pickled data can execute arbitrary code. If pickles are
            disallowed, loading object arrays will fail.
            Please be aware that CuPy does not support arrays with dtype of
            `object`.
            The default is False.
            This option is available only for NumPy 1.10 or later.
            In NumPy 1.9, this option cannot be specified (loading pickled
            objects is always allowed).

    Returns:
        CuPy array or NpzFile object depending on the type of the file. NpzFile
        object is a dictionary-like object with the context manager protocol
        (which enables us to use *with* statement on it).
